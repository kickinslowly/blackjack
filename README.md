plays online blackjack using pyautogui

This is for fun and to practice skills learned. I used pyautogui to manipulate mouse/keyboard. I had to take a bunch of screenshots of the blackjack game so that I could get pyautogui to recognize the total of cards played. 

The game is not high level, plays very basicly, hits or stands. And it occasionally makes mistakes, such as recognizing 13 as 18 and standing instead of hitting. It can't split, and it doesn't take into account what the dealer has showing.

I am sure that as I learn more I will find ways to streamline the code, I am sure there are erros in my if, elif and else statements, as well as the way I am refreshing the variables. All in all, it works pretty well and I'm having fun watching my computer play blackjack.
